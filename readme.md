This was an experiment in creating an HTML5 game using the Component-Entity-System paradigm.

Built using the https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty library it's based on the pong demo.

Basically I added:
* Animated Sprites instead of static blocks of colour
* Tennis court and ball
* AI - Play against the computer
* Sound effects
* Music
* Resizable to your browser
